Scripts for the linux system that facilitate my usage overall.

This has been updated quite a couple of times, many scripts were deleted and replaced with system tools when I switched from X11 to Wayland.

Some scripts are written in [Nushell](www.nushell.sh/) and soon, all of them are going to be in it, too!
