Scripts for the linux system that facilitate my usage overall.

This has been updated quite a couple of times, many scripts were deleted and replaced with system tools when I switched from X11 to Wayland.

Some scripts are written in [Nushell](www.nushell.sh/) and soon, all of them are going to be in it, too!

- [doasedit](./bin/doasedit) is a helper *sudoedit* alike, made to edit high-access files in the local editor.
- [clear_desktop.nu](./bin/clear_desktop.nu) kills all processes of the user launching the process.
- [fuzzel-emoji](./bin/fuzzel-emoji) gives a list of emojis and kaomojis with respective tags to choose from.
- [fetch](./bin/fetch) a simple fetch utility for [Artix Linux](https://artixlinux.org/) operating systems.
- [adq](./bin/adq) adds one, or two, or three new strings into a JSON at the top of the file.
